			<h1>The Benefits and Implications of Self-Driving Car Networks</h1>
			<h2>Self driving cars offer many tempting advantages.</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Gated intersections become a thing of the past - computers can guide vehicles between the spaces of others in cross traffic.</li>
				<p></P>
				<li>Computers could effectively manage a smaller distance between cars at higher speeds, increasing freeway capacity and decreasing traffic.</li>
				<p></P>
				<li>These advantages are only fully realized if all cars are self driving, and all are on a network to communicate.</li>
				<p></P>
			</ul>
			<h3>This video shows what these intersections might look like.</h3>

			<h3>This video explains how the protocol to control such an intersection has already been created.</h3>

			<h2>The existence of such a network has serious implications.</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The Supreme Court has already ruled against location-based tracking without a warrant.</li>
				<ul>

				</ul>
				<p></P>
				<li>We can't be on an interconnected network without signing away our right have our location known.</li>
				<p></P>
				<li>Would the government and law enforcement take advantage of this and keep track of our exact location and habits?</li>
				<p></P>
			</ul>
			<h2>They've already done everything they can to get around this law.</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>License plate scanning technology has been around for a long time.</li>
				<p></P>
				<li>Law enforcement has combined this technology with surveillance systems to create dragnet tracking and massive databases of people's movements.</li>
				<ul>
					<li><a href='https://www.aclu.org/feature/you-are-being-tracked'>ACLU article</a> on how local law enforcement currently employs this technology.</li>
					<li><a href='https://www.aclu.org/feature/you-are-being-tracked'>Washington Post article</a> on Federal government plans to centralize the process.</li>
				</ul>
				<p></P>
				<li>This type of tracking is very limited - it requires massive storage to maintain, and doesn't give accurate real-time location of individuals.</li>
				<p></P>
			</ul>
